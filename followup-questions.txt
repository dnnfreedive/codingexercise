Questions
1. What enhancements might you make to your solution given more time?

I’d spend more time on less/greater predicates to handle date type as well as string, decimal.
I’d add logging.
I’d externalise funding opportunities into external json file and make tests (and app itself) read this file as an input

2. What considerations would you take if releasing this as a production application?
Considering releasing this API to production I’d review how this API will actually be used
- i.e. how funding opportunities will be streamed with criteria applied and successful ones will be collected (ones which satisfy complex criteria)
Will apply Enhancements from above
Will add API documentation
